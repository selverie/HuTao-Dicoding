            <p>Hu Tao is medium-sized girl with long brown hair tied in a pair of pigtails that fades into red at the
                tips and a black hat adorned by a yellow emblem along with red blossoms and blue ribbons tied to said
                flowers at the side of the hat. Her eyes are red with pale gold pupils resembling stars. She wears a red
                shirt with a mandarin collar. Worn over said shirt is a black coat that bears a darker collar than her
                shirt and sleeve cuffs. Along with her Pyro Vision, the back of her coat is adorned by
                rectangular-shaped coattails, and golden brooches attached underneath the collar and waist. Her shorts
                match her coat and bear gold details. Her socks worn over her black high-heels are white and reach the
                middle of her calves and have red straps with plum flowers that are wrapped around the cuffs.</p>

            <p>Hu Tao is a very perky and cheerful young woman. She's very energetic, even when pursuing her job on
                reflecting/discussing grim subjects such as death (something that her entire job revolves around).
                In fact, she bears an enthusiasm when talking about things that are generally seen as dark or scary
                such as death or supernatural phenomenons that many other characters find uncanny. This, along with
                her tendency to pull pranks on others, has caused many others to dislike or grow distrustful of Hu
                Tao. This particularly Qiqi, whose hatred of the director stems from her trying to bury the little
                zombie's body before she was resurrected later on.</p>
            <p>
                While generally absent-minded and odd, Hu Tao still takes her job very seriously, having dedicated
                herself to making sure the souls of the deceased pass safely on to the afterlife. When she isn't
                pulling pranks or sending souls to the afterlife, Hu Tao spends much of her time writing poems by
                the oil of midnight or taking strolls across the mountains or seas so fast that they are reminiscent
                of teleportation.</p>
